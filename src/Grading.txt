Great work!

No points off this time but, according to the style guidelines, variable names need to start with lowercase letters.
You used "HP" as a variable name.  It might take some getting used to, but even acronyms can be lowercase in variable names, and
it will make more sense to other programmers reading your code if you write an acronym like HP as "hp" in a variable name or method
name.

Your indents also got a little bit off with your damage() method, but not enough to warrant a point deduction this time.
